# Pokedex Frontend App

React application with key dependencies: react, mobx, react-router-4, antd

#### Install dependencies:

-   install packages: `npm i`
-   start development server: `npm run dev`
-   build production to /build folder: `npm run build`

### Front End Candidate Requirements:

    1. List pokemons in a table view (or cards) with their name, avatar, type (should visually look as a colored tag) and the main pokemon stats (whichever additional pokemon info you want to show)
    2. The list must have a pagination with an ability to select how many items to show per page (10 / 20 / 50)
    3. Filter the pokemons by name with a search box
    4. Filter the pokemons by type using tags (multiple selected tags have to show pokemons with any of the types selected)
    5. ** Show your skills

#### My notes about improvement:

    1. Caching list of pokemons in localStorage
    2. Define Proptypes
    3. Eslint errors
    4. More represented UI
    5. and etc!
