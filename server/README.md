# Pokedex Backend App

Express.js application

#### Install dependencies:

-   install packages: `npm i`
-   start development server: `npm run dev`
-   build production to /build folder: `npm run build`

### Full Stack Candidate Requirements:

    1. Everything from the list of the front end requirements
    2. User management system with at least one social service login (like facebook)
    3. A profile page where the user can see a list of his favourite pokemons (each pokemon needs to have a star icon to make it favourite)
    4. ** Show your skills

#### My notes about improvement:

    1. Single auth module
    2. Eslint errors
    3. Store session in db
    4. Dev/Prod constants
    5. and etc!
